                            Your resume should be no longer than 1-2 pages. Keep
                            it to 1 page if you have less than 8 years of
                            professional work experience. If you have more, you
                            might consider using 2 pages.

                            important. This step will prove highly valuable if
                            the company uses ATS (applicant tracking system).
