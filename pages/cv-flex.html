                                Your resume should be no longer than 1-2 pages.
                                Keep it to 1 page if you have less than 8 years
                                of professional work experience. If you have
                                more, you might consider using 2 pages.

                                Include a skills section - it's incredibly
                                important. This step will prove highly valuable
                                if the company uses ATS (applicant tracking

                                job description, submit your resume in pdf
                                format. You can convert this file to pdf in
                                google docs by going to File, select Download,
                                and then pdf.

                                depending on the duration and relevance of the
                                position. Keep sections that are less relevant
                                to the job you're applying to short.

                                relevant to the one you're applying for.

                                or your areas of responsibility, you need to
                                quantify the impact of your work. Recruiters
                                scan resumes for numbers, so quantify as much as
                                you can.

                                You can talk about xx% improvement your
                                initiatives yielded.

                            <li>
                                Or you could mention the increase in company
                                revenue of xx% that your work contributed to.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Avoid writing bullet points that are longer than
                                2 lines. No recruiter will read bullet points
                                that are as long as paragraphs.
                            </li>

                                Carefully review your resume several times to
                                eliminate any typos. Additionally, consider
                                having someone else proofread it to prevent
                                sending an imperfect resume.
